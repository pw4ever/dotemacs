;;; Commentary:

;; Local playground for the Go programs similar to play.golang.org.
;; `M-x go-playground` and type you golang code then make&run it with `C-Return`.

;; Playground works around `go-mode` and requires preconfigured environment
;; for Go language.

;; I recommend you to use `goimports` instead of `gofmt` for automatically make
;; import clauses. It very comfortable especially for experimenting with code
;; in playground.

;; You may push code to play.golang.org with go-mode' function `go-play-buffer`.
