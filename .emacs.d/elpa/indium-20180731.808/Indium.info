     Copyright © 2018, Nicolas Petton

Indium is a JavaScript development environment for Emacs(1).

Indium is Free Software, licensed under the GPL v3.0.  You can follow
its development on GitHub(2).

Indium connects to a browser tab or nodejs process and provides several
features for JavaScript development, including:

   * a REPL (with auto completion) & object inspection;

   * an inspector, with history and navigation;

   * a scratch buffer (‘M-x indium-scratch’);

   * JavaScript evaluation in JS buffers with ‘indium-interaction-mode’;

   * a stepping Debugger, similar to ‘edebug’, or ‘cider’.

This documentation can be read online at ‘https://indium.readthedocs.io’
and in Info format (within Emacs with ‘(info "Indium")’).

It is also available in Info format and can be consulted from within
Emacs with ‘C-h i m indium RET’.

1.1 Installation
================

     Note: If you already have installed ‘Jade’, you should read the
     migration-from-jade page first.

Indium supports ‘Emacs 25.3+’, works with ‘Chrome’ (debugging protocol
‘v1.2’, see *note Chrome/Chromium requirements: 5.) and ‘NodeJS’, see
*note NodeJS requirements: 6.

Indium is availabe on MELPA(1), MELPA Stable(2).

1.1.1 Using MELPA
-----------------

Unless you are already using MELPA, you will have to setup ‘package.el’
to use MELPA or MELPA Stable repositories.  You can follow this
documentation(1).

You can install Indium with the following command:

     M-x package-install [RET] indium [RET]

or by adding this bit of Emacs Lisp code to your Emacs initialization
file (‘.emacs’ or ‘init.el’):

     (unless (package-installed-p 'indium)
       (package-install 'indium))

If the installation doesn’t work try refreshing the package list:

     M-x package-refresh-contents [RET]

1.2.1 Project configuration
---------------------------

Place a ‘.indium.json’ file in the root folder of your JavaScript
project.  The project file can contain one or many configurations
settings for NodeJS (see *note NodeJS configuration options: e.) and
Chrome/Chromium (see *note Chrome/Chromium configuration options: f.).

Here is a minimalist ‘.indium.json’ file.:

     {
       "configurations": [
         {
           "name": "Web project",
           "type": "chrome"
         }
       ]
     }


File: Indium.info,  Node: General configuration,  Next: Chrome/Chromium configuration options,  Prev: Project configuration,  Up: Getting up and running

1.2.2 General configuration
---------------------------

The ‘.indium.json’ file can contain as many configurations as needed,
and mix any supported configuration types.

The currently supported ‘type’ values are ‘"chrome"’ and ‘"node"’.

The root directory of the source files is by default set to the
directory where this ‘.indium.json’ file is placed, but it can be
overridden with the ‘root’ (or the ‘webRoot’ alias) option:

     {
       "configurations": [
         {
           "type": "chrome",
           "root": "src"
         }
       ]
     }

Custom sourcemap path overrides can be set with
‘sourceMapPathOverrides’, see *note Using sourcemaps: 12. for mode
information on sourcemaps and debugging.

1.2.3 Chrome/Chromium configuration options
-------------------------------------------


host: Host on which Chrome is running (defaults to ‘"localhost"’).


port: Port on which Chrome is running (defaults to ‘9222’).


url: Url to open when running ‘indium-launch’.

Example configuration:

     {
       "configurations": [
         {
           "name": "Web project",
           "type": "chrome",
           "host": 192.168.22.1,
           "url": "http://192.168.22.1/myproject/index.html",
           "port": 9222
         }

1.2.4 NodeJS configuration options
----------------------------------


command: Nodejs command to start a new process.  The ‘--inspect’ flag
will be added automatically.


inspect-brk: Whether Indium should break at the first statement (true by
default).


host: Host on which the Node inspector is listening (defaults to
‘"localhost"’).


port: Port on which the Node inspector is listening (defaults to 9229).

Here is an example configuration for debugging Gulp tasks:

     {
       "configurations": [
         {
           "name": "Gulp",
           "type": "node",
           "command": "node ./node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js",
           "inspect-brk": true
         }
       ]
     }


File: Indium.info,  Node: Starting Indium,  Next: NodeJS requirements,  Prev: NodeJS configuration options,  Up: Getting up and running

1.2.5 Starting Indium
---------------------

Indium can be started in two modes:

   - Connect: ‘M-x indium-connect’ Connect indium to a running runtime
     from one of the configurations in the ‘.indium.json’ project file.

   - Launch: ‘M-x indium-launch’ Start a JavaScript process (Chrome or
     NodeJS) as specified from the configurations in the ‘.indium.json’
     project file.


File: Indium.info,  Node: NodeJS requirements,  Next: Chrome/Chromium requirements,  Prev: Starting Indium,  Up: Getting up and running

1.2.6 NodeJS requirements
-------------------------

Nodejs >= ‘8.x’ is required for Indium to work.

If your distribution ships an old version of NodeJS, you can install a
more recent version using nvm(1):

     $ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.2/install.sh | bash

Once ‘nvm’ is install, you can easily install and use the version of
NodeJS you want:

     $ nvm install v8
     $ nvm alias default v8
     $ node --version

If you install NodeJS using ‘nvm’, chances are that Emacs won’t have it
in its ‘exec path’.  A simple solution is to use the excellent
exec-path-from-shell(2) package.

File: Indium.info,  Node: Chrome/Chromium requirements,  Prev: NodeJS requirements,  Up: Getting up and running

1.2.7 Chrome/Chromium requirements
----------------------------------

Chrome/Chromium >= ‘60.0’ is required for Indium to properly work
(debugging protocol ‘v1.2’).

Start Chrome/Chromium with the ‘--remote-debugging-port’ flag like the
following:

     chromium --remote-debugging-port=9222 https://localhost:3000

Make sure that no instance of Chrome is already running, otherwise
Chrome will simply open a new tab on the existing Chrome instance, and
the ‘remote-debugging-port’ will not be set.

---------------------

A REPL (Read Eval Print Loop) buffer is automatically open when a new
Indium connection is made (see *note Getting up and running: 9.).

 [image src="repl.png" ]

The REPL offers the following features:

   * Auto completion with ‘company-mode’

   * JS syntax highlighting

   * Pretty printing and preview of printed values

   * Access to the object inspector (see *note The inspector: 1d.)

...................

Here is the list of available keybindings in a REPL buffer:

Keybinding        Description
                  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  
‘RET’             Evalute the current input.  When the point is on a printed object, inspect the object.
                  
                  
‘C-RET’           Insert a newline.
                  
                  
‘C-c M-i’         Evalute the current input and open an inspector on the result.
                  
                  
‘C-c C-o’         Clear the output.
                  
                  
‘C-c C-q’         Kill the REPL buffer and close the current connection.
                  
                  
‘M-n’             Insert the previous input in the history.
                  
                  
‘M-p’             Instert the next input in the history.

1.3.2.2 Reconnecting from the REPL buffer
.........................................

When a connection is closed (most probably because other devtools were
open on the same runtime), the REPL will display two buttons, one to try
to reopen the connection, and another one to kill Emacs buffers using
this connection (the REPL buffer, inspectors & debuggers).


File: Indium.info,  Node: Code evaluation & context,  Prev: Using the REPL,  Up: The REPL

1.3.3 Code evaluation & context
-------------------------------

When evaluating code in the REPL, Indium will always run the code on the
current execution context.

This means that while debugging, code execution will happen in the
context of the current stack frame, and will be able to access local
variables from the stack, etc.


File: Indium.info,  Node: Interaction in JS buffers,  Next: The stepping debugger,  Prev: The REPL,  Up: Table of contents

1.4 Interaction in JS buffers
=============================

Indium comes with a minor mode called ‘indium-interaction-mode’ for
interactive programming.  To enable it in all JavaScript buffers, add
something like the following to your Emacs configuration:

     (require 'indium)
     (add-hook 'js-mode-hook #'indium-interaction-mode)

When ‘indium-interaction-mode’ is on, you can evaluate code, inspect
objects and add or remove breakpoints from your buffers.

* Menu:

* Evaluating and inspecting::
* Switching to the REPL buffer::
* Adding and removing breakpoints::
* Live code update (hot-swapping JavaScript sources): Live code update hot-swapping JavaScript sources.


File: Indium.info,  Node: Evaluating and inspecting,  Next: Switching to the REPL buffer,  Up: Interaction in JS buffers

1.4.1 Evaluating and inspecting
-------------------------------

Here’s a list of available keybindings:

   - ‘C-x C-e’: Evaluate the JavaScript expression preceding the point.

   - ‘C-M-x’: Evaluate the innermost function enclosing the point.

   - ‘C-c M-i’: Inspect the result of the evaluation of an expression
     (see *note The inspector: 1d.).

   - ‘C-c M-:’: Prompt for an expression to evaluate and inspect.

   - ‘M-x indium-eval-buffer’: Evaluate the entire buffer.

   - ‘M-x indium-eval-region’: Evaluate the current region.

1.4.2 Switching to the REPL buffer
----------------------------------

Press ‘C-c C-z’ from any buffer with ‘indium-interaction-mode’ turned on
to switch back to the REPL buffer (see *note The REPL: 19.).


File: Indium.info,  Node: Adding and removing breakpoints,  Next: Live code update hot-swapping JavaScript sources,  Prev: Switching to the REPL buffer,  Up: Interaction in JS buffers

1.4.3 Adding and removing breakpoints
-------------------------------------

You need to first make sure that Indium is set up correctly to use local
files (see local-files).

   - ‘C-c b b’: Add a breakpoint

   - ‘C-c b c’: Add a conditional breakpoint

   - ‘C-c b k’: Remove a breakpoint

   - ‘C-c b t’: Toggle a breakpoint

   - ‘C-c b K’: Remove all breakpoints from the current buffer

   - ‘C-c b e’: Edit condition of a breakpoint

   - ‘C-c b l’: List all breakpoints and easily jump to any breakpoint

   - ‘C-c b d’: Deactivate all breakpoints (the runtime won’t pause when
     hitting a breakpoint)

   - ‘C-c b a’: Activate all breakpoints (it has no effect if
     breakpoints have not been deactivated)

The left fringe or margin can also be clicked to add or remove
breakpoints.

Once a breakpoint is set, execution will stop when a breakpoint is hit,
and the Indium debugger pops up (see *note The stepping debugger: 28.).

Since Indium 0.7, breakpoints are supported in source files with an
associated sourcemap, see *note Using sourcemaps: 12.

     Note: Breakpoints are persistent: if the connection is closed, when
     a new connection is made Indium will attempt to add back all
     breakpoints.


File: Indium.info,  Node: Live code update hot-swapping JavaScript sources,  Prev: Adding and removing breakpoints,  Up: Interaction in JS buffers

1.4.4 Live code update (hot-swapping JavaScript sources)
--------------------------------------------------------

Indium supports live code updates without the need to reload the browser
tab or restart the nodejs process.

This feature works with by hot-swapping the script source, and works
even with lexical closures.

     Note: This feature currently in only available for Chrome &
     Chromium.

To enable live updates, make sure Indium is set up to use local files
(see local-files).

   - ‘C-c C-k’: Updates the runtime JavaScript source with the contents
     of the current buffer (this is also done automatically when a
     buffer is saved).

You can setup a hook to be run after each script update.  For example

     (add-hook 'indium-update-script-source-hook
             (lambda (url)
               (indium-eval (format "window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('patch', {detail: {url: '%s'}}))"
                                    url))))

Then you can use it in your app for development purposes

     window.addEventListener("patch", (event) => {
       console.log("Patched @ " + new Date().toTimeString().substring(0, 8), event.detail.url);
       // rerender, etc
     });

File: Indium.info,  Node: Using sourcemaps,  Next: Blackboxing scripts,  Up: The stepping debugger

1.5.1 Using sourcemaps
----------------------

Since version 0.7, Indium uses sourcemap files by default.

For sourcemaps to work properly with Chrome/Chromium, make sure that a
workspace is correctly set (see *note Getting up and running: 9.).

If you wish to disable sourcemaps when debugging, set
‘indium-script-enable-sourcemaps’ to ‘nil’.

* Menu:

* Overriding sourcemap paths::


File: Indium.info,  Node: Overriding sourcemap paths,  Up: Using sourcemaps

1.5.1.1 Overriding sourcemap paths
..................................

Some sourcemaps cannot be used as is and need path rewriting to map to
locations on disks.

Indium provides the configuration option ‘sourceMapPathOverrides’ for
providing custom sourcemap paths.

The default mapping works well for Webpack projects:

     {
       "webpack:///./~/": "${root}/node_modules/",
       "webpack:///./":   "${root}/",
       "webpack:///":     "/",
       "webpack:///src/": "${root}/"
     }

Overriding the ‘sourceMapPathOverrides’ option will erase the default
mapping.


File: Indium.info,  Node: Blackboxing scripts,  Prev: Using sourcemaps,  Up: The stepping debugger

1.5.2 Blackboxing scripts
-------------------------

The custom variable ‘indium-debugger-blackbox-regexps’ holds a list of
regular expression of script paths to blackbox when debugging.

Blackboxed scripts are skipped when stepping in the debugger.


File: Indium.info,  Node: The inspector,  Next: Network,  Prev: The stepping debugger,  Up: Table of contents

1.6 The inspector
=================

Indium features an object inspector that can be open on any object
reference from a REPL buffer (see *note The REPL: 19.), the debugger
(see *note The stepping debugger: 28.), or the result of any evaluation
of JavaScript code (see *note Interaction in JS buffers: 23.).

To inspect the result of the evaluation of an expression, press ‘C-c
M-i’.  An inspector buffer will pop up.  You can also press ‘RET’ or
left click on object links from the REPL buffer.

===========

You can disable or enable network cache using the following commands:

     M-x indium-v8-disable-cache
     M-x indium-v8-enable-cache

Both commands save your choice which will be used for future Indium
connections for the current Emacs session.

You can make the cache setting permament by setting
‘indium-v8-cache-disabled’:

     (setq indium-v8-cache-disabled t)
